Some answers to the ECHO problem in various programming languages.

ECHO is distributed under the Unlicense.  

You task is to implement the echo command for a sequence of integers: rewrite integers from input to output.
The program is a starting point for solving more interesting problems.

** Input
   A sequence of integers (at most 200000) between 1 and 1000000.
** Output
   The sequence given as input. Print one integer per line.
** Example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
